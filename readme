**Churn EDA Project README**

---

### Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on customer churn. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a company or service. The goal of this project is to explore the factors that influence churn behavior among customers using data analysis techniques.

### Project Structure:
- **data**: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis. (e.g., CSV, Excel, etc.)
- **notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the code.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all Python dependencies required to run the code.

### Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadumair862/Churn-Data-EDA.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd churn-eda-project
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis conducted on the dataset.

### Data:
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers and their churn behavior. It includes various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and churn status.

### Methodology:
The analysis follows a standard data exploration process, including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them.
- Visualization of key insights.
- Statistical analysis to identify significant factors influencing churn.

### Results:
The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights that can help understand the drivers of churn among customers.
